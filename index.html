    <p>Jeremy is Asha's first character. He was created when Willow Flesh Gazelle Benson hit her over the head with a paper, and she
        passed out for almost the entire rest of sixth period. Willow introduced themself to Jeremy as "Jeremy, and we met in the 1960s". 
        Asha was then Jeremy for the rest of soccer practice, developing a connection to Boz who was at soccer practice.
        <hr>
        Jeremy knew nothing when he first came into existence, but the knowledge he collects stays with him whenever he is brought to life
        by Asha getting hit with a paper. Jeremy also seems to time out after a while, and Asha returns without her getting hit over the 
        head with paper.
